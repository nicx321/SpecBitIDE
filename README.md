# SpecBitIDE
This is basic IDE for logisim CPU architectures, which you can find in my GitHub. Or you can make your own "Compiler", you just have to add folder "Version_?" where ? specifies version 0-9 is recommender but A-Z and a-z should work too. Inside that folder you need a "exa.nxa" this file should contain Example code. "Help.txt" This should have Help (Unexpected...). And "Comp.py", This is compiling script which will be called after pressing compile button. Input should be read from "Input.txt" and saved to "Output.txt", after this, script should return number 1234 as mark of good execution of compile script.<br/>
